This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

**Before Submitting A Bug Report:**

* Check the [issues](https://github.com/collective-compass/collective-compass/issues) to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
* Use the [issue template](https://github.com/collective-compass/collective-compass/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) to create the report.

**How Do I Submit A Good Bug Report?**

* Use a clear and descriptive title.
* Describe the exact steps to reproduce the problem.
* Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps.
* Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps.
* Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
* Include screenshots if possible.
* Include your environment details (OS, browser, etc.).

### Suggesting Enhancements

* Use the [feature request template](https://github.com/collective-compass/collective-compass/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md).

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

* [Beginner issues](https://github.com/collective-compass/collective-compass/labels/good%20first%20issue) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/collective-compass/collective-compass/labels/help%20wanted) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

### Pull Requests

* Fill in the required template
* Do not include issue numbers in the PR title
* Include screenshots and animated GIFs in your pull request whenever possible
* Follow the [JavaScript](#javascript-styleguide) and [CSS](#css-styleguide) styleguides

### JavaScript Styleguide

All JavaScript code is linted with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and formatted with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).

* Prefer the object spread operator (`{...anotherObj}`) to `Object.assign()`
