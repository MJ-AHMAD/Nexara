Try clearing some browser storage or using a different browser.

- Close unused browser tabs

### Why are some features not working on mobile?

Some features may have limited functionality on mobile devices due to screen size constraints or browser capabilities. We're continuously working to improve mobile support.

### I forgot my password for protected sections. What can I do?

Since the password is stored in your environment variables, you can change it by updating your `.env.local` file and restarting the application.
